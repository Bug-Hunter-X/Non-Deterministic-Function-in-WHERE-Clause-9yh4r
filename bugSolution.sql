To fix this, ensure that all functions used in the WHERE clause are deterministic. If a non-deterministic function is necessary, consider refactoring your query to avoid using it in the WHERE clause. For example, you could use a subquery to pre-compute the results of the non-deterministic function before applying the filter.  Alternatively, if the function's non-determinism is acceptable in this context, you can add an appropriate comment explaining the function's behavior and any potential impact of its non-determinism.
